# Learn, think and implement Dynamic Programming for beginners in python. 

All the pieces of codes follow Youtube video from freecodecamp.org by Alvin Zablan from Coderbyte titled [Dynamic Programming - Learn to Solve Algorithmic Problems & Coding Challenges](https://youtu.be/oBt53YbR9Kk) 

I have tried to give different ways of solving same problem mainly in following ways - 
- Recursion
- DP-Recursion with memoization (top-down approach)
- DP-Tabulation (bottom-up approach) (iterative)
- DP-Space optimized bottom-up approach
