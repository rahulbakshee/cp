"""(Stack Simulation)
Use a stack to simulate asteroid movement and collision.
Push asteroids moving right (> 0) onto the stack.
When a left-moving asteroid (< 0) comes in, check for collisions with 
the stackâ€™s top (which will be a right-moving asteroid)."""
# Overall cases
# 1- both moving same direction(positive, positive) - No collision
# 2- both moving same direction(negative, negative) - NO collision
# 3- both moving in opposite direction
    # 3.1- prev is positive, upcoming is negative - YES collision
    # 3.2- prev is negative, upcoming is positive - NO collision"""
