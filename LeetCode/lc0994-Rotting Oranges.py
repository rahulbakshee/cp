"""Multi-Source BFS - time:O(mn), space:O(mn)
Initialize:
    - Traverse the grid to:
        - Count the number of fresh oranges.
        - Add positions of all rotten oranges to a queue â€” 
        these are the starting points for BFS.
BFS Traversal:
    - Use a queue to perform BFS level by level, representing 
    each minute that passes.
    - For each rotten orange in the queue, rot all adjacent 
    fresh oranges (up/down/left/right) and add them to the queue.
    - After each BFS level (minute), increment the time counter.
Final Check:
    - If all fresh oranges are rotted during BFS, return the total 
    time (BFS depth).
    - If any fresh oranges remain unrotted (i.e., unreachable), 
    return -1.
