""" using hashmap
 - Build a map (hashmap) of each character to its last index in the string.
 - Iterate through the string and for each character:
     - Expand the current partition's end to the farthest last occurrence 
     of any character seen so far.
 - When the current index i reaches end, it means:
     - All characters in this partition donâ€™t appear later.
     - Finalize the partition and start a new one."""
