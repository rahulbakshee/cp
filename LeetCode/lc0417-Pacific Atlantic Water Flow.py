"""DFS from Ocean Borders to inner cells - time:O(mn), space:O(mn)
ðŸ’¡ Key Idea: Instead of checking if each cell can reach both oceans, we 
start DFS from the oceans' edges and see which cells can flow into them.
WE REVERSE THE FLOW: water can only go from lower or equal height to higher 
or equal height, so we traverse "uphill" from the oceans.
- Initialize two visited sets:
    - pacific: cells that can flow to the Pacific Ocean (top and left borders).
    - atl: cells that can flow to the Atlantic Ocean (bottom and right borders).
- Run DFS from each ocean's border:
    - For Pacific: top row and left column.
    - For Atlantic: bottom row and right column.
    - In DFS, only move to neighbors with height â‰¥ current, since water can only
     flow from higher to lower in the reverse DFS.
 - Intersection:The result is the list of cells that exist in both pac and atl."""
