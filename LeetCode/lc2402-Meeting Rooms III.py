iterarte over meetings, sorted by start time
For each meeting:
 - Free up rooms that have finished by the current meeting's start time
    - Pop from used and push room back to available.
 - If available is not empty:
     - Assign the room with the lowest number.
     - pop from available and Push to used.
 - If no room is free:
     - Wait for the earliest finishing room from used
     - Delay the meeting to that roomâ€™s end time, preserving duration.
     - Push the new (delayed_end_time, room_number) to used.
 - Track the count of meetings per room using a counter array.
 - return highest count room
