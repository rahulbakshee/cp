Data Problem #1: Four Person Elevator [Postmates]


- what is the probability that no two passengers will get off at the same floor?
Total number of ways of assigning 5 floors to 4 passangers is 5x5x5x5 because each passanger can choose one of the 5 floors. 
The number of ways for all passangers getting off at different floors will be 5x4x3x2 because first passanger has 5 floors to get off, second one has 4 floors, third one has 3 and so on...

so the probablity of them getting all at different floors is 5x4x3x2 / 5x5x5x5 = 24/125


- what is the probability that all passengers will get off at the same floor?
Total number of ways of assigning 5 floors to 4 passangers is 5x5x5x5 because each passanger can choose one of the 5 floors. 
The number of ways for all passangers getting off at same floors will be 5 because either it can happen at floor#1 or floor#2 ...so on...or floor#5.

so the probablity of them getting all at same floors is 5 / 5x5x5x5 = 1/125
