# 1- Machine Learning Systems Design book

One of the very good books that I have been reading recently is Machine Learning Systems Design by Chip Huyen. This book talks about the questions one might get in an interview related to system design to evaluate one's knowledge, implementation ability, and critical thinking skills. Also, what are the questions and clarifications the interviewee should be asking before/during attempting those questions.

At the end, she has included 27 open-ended questions on system design which I will try to answer(and keep updating them) as I move forward in this learning journey. 

I highly encourage you to read her [Machine Learning Systems Design book](https://github.com/chiphuyen/machine-learning-systems-design)
